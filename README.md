# MYSQL

## current_date() and current_time()

we have three column in this table with date,time and datetime type.

for the current date when we want to insert value we use the CURRENT_DATE() function
to get the current date and it's true for the current time with CURRENT_TIME() function.

for the datetime we can use the NOW() function.

we can use the - and + for time to pass it or back in the time.
